I have been investigating the high CPU utilization issue on the Windows Server 2019 VM cpu01. After thorough analysis, it appears that the root cause of the CPU spikes exceeding 95% is due to a combination of processes and services consuming resources abnormally.\n\nTo further diagnose and monitor the performance of the server, I have developed a PowerShell script that collects perfmon logs. This script will help us gain insights into the specific processes and system components responsible for the high CPU utilization.\n\nI will continue to analyze the collected data and aim to provide a comprehensive report with actionable recommendations to optimize the server's performance and stability. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or require additional information.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nTechnical Team",

## Summary
Both examples executed successfully:

1. **Direct Execution (Example A)**:
   - Successfully diagnosed CPU issues on Windows Server
   - Generated PowerShell script for perfmon logs
   - Created management email draft
   - Completed without requiring approval

2. **Approval Flow (Example B)**:
   - Created task requiring approval
   - Generated Azure CLI commands for RDP port locking
   - Successfully completed after approval
   - Produced appropriate email draft for Azure team

The automated script successfully handled both scenarios, demonstrating the system's ability to process both direct execution and approval-based workflows.
